\title{Helpers for working with inForm data}
\description{
informr contains functions that make it easier to read and analyze data tables
created by PerkinElmer's inForm software.
}
\details{
\code{\link{read_cell_seg_data}} reads inForm cell segmentation data tables
and makes them easier to use in R.

\code{\link{distance_matrix}} and \code{\link{subset_distance_matrix}}
create and subset cell distance matrices from cell segmentation data.
\code{\link{find_nearest_distance}} uses a distance matrix to find
the distance from each cell to the nearest cell of each phenotype.

\code{\link{read_maps}} reads inForm segmentation maps.

\code{\link{select_rows}} helps select rows in cell segmentation data
corresponding to specific phenotypes and expression levels.
